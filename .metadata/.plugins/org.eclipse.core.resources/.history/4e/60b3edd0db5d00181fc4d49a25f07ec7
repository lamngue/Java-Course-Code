Name: Lam Nguyen

Hours to complete assignment (optional):

I made the game similar to what the question 14.35 asked. I tried implement
all the methods in question 14.35 and additional MagicScroll class that 
collects chocolates from everywhere in the World but seems like it's not 
working properly.

The game's goal is to give Max the late lab report, once you give him the report
then the winning dialog box displays and the game exits if you click okay or close
that dialog box.
